This is the Tic Tac Toe project from TheOdinProject's full stack JavaScript curriculum. It has 4 modes:
1. PvP: This mode let's you play against another player. It allows the players to input their names and to restart the game without having to enter their names     again.
2. Solo(Easy): This mode let's you play against the AI. It marks a random cell when it's the AI's turn to pick,but never picks an already marked cell.
3. Solo (Hard): Same as Solo(Easy), but uses the minimax algorithm to make a smart choice.
4. Solo (Medium): Combines Solo(Easy) and Solo(Hard). Every it's the AI's turn there's a chance it makes a random choice. Otherwise it uses the minimax algorithm.
